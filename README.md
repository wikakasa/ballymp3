Bally's MP3s


Basically an online soundtrack player with soundtracks of some games etc.


if there is an update to the /music.html website but it wont appear on you're app, clear cache for that website or app...
cache of macos build location: ~/Library/Application Support/ballys-mps   or   Users/Username/Library/Application Support/ballys-mps
cache of windows build should be somewere in appdata (windows+r and then %appdata%) or in the folder of the app
cache of linux should be somewere in the home folder / partition or in the folder of the app.

WIP!
